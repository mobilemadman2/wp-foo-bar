Template plugin for scaffolding WordPress plugins at XWP.

== Description ==

Template plugin for scaffolding WordPress plugins at XWP.

Use the [`init-plugin.sh`](init-plugin.sh) script on your system to pull down this repo and make the necessary replacements via:

```bash
./init-plugin.sh xwp "Hello World"
```

This will create a plugin `hello-world` one level up from the current directory. The `init-plugin.sh` script will be removed from the generated plugin.
